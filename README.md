# AI_Voice_Dubbing_App
A project to develop an AI voice dubbing app 
# AI-Powered Voice Dubbing App  
## 🚀 Project Idea  
I want to develop an app that can **instantly dub any video into any language** while keeping the **original voice effect**.  

## 🔥 Why This is Needed  
- Many people struggle to watch foreign-language content.  
- Current dubbing solutions are slow, expensive, and change the speaker’s voice.  
- This app will use **AI voice cloning & real-time translation** to solve this problem.  

## 👨‍💻 Who I'm Looking For  
- AI/ML developers with experience in **speech-to-text, AI translation, and voice cloning**.  
- App developers (Android/iOS) to help build the platform.  

## 💰 Compensation & Collaboration  
- Looking for **a technical co-founder** or developers interested in working together.  
- Open to revenue-sharing or seeking funding together.  

## 📩 How to Contact Me
